The Purpose of this project is to show my understanding of C++ by creating this pong game. By using Structures, Classes, and Recursion, I was able to create this pong game. This game stays true and simple to regular pong and using the topics I was required to use, I was able to make my own recreation of this fan beloved game. This project was very fun to design and create and I hope you enjoy it.
